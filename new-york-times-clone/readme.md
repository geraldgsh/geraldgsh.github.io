# Microverse - Positioning and Floating Elements - [Collaborative Project]

## Introduction

This assignment consists of making a clone of a New York Times article page. By this point, the student should be familiar with the concepts of:

-Embedding images
-Working with forms (buttons in this case)
-Floats and positioning
-The box model

This project requires students to copy this article from the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0).

Project specific

Please use <aside> tag for Editor's picks section on the rightmost side.
Align all elements with float.

Steps

1. Go to the NYT article in question and have a look around.

2. Follow the instructions atop the Google Homepage project to set up a Github repository for this project (of course you’ll need to change the title).

3. Create a new HTML document.

4. Think about all the elements on the page and how they are grouped together.

5. Lay out the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and positioned. You may want to make their background colors different so you can see them. Don’t forget to use your browser’s developer tools (right click on the page, click “inspect element”)!

6. Set up the top navigation bar (again, don’t worry about making it change when you scroll down the page). How can you get it to stick to the top of the page as you scroll down?

7. Fill in and position the additional sections. Don’t worry about enclosing every paragraph of text in <p> tags.
Push your solution to Github.
