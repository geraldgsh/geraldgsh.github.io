# Microverse - Building with Backgrounds and Gradients - [Solo Project]

## Introduction

This project consists of building a webpage using images as a background and adding gradients to elements. The goal is to make a clone of old an old version of the Apple website webpage.

You can find the original project specification at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients

This project requires students to copy this page from the [Apple](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).

Project specific
Align all elements with float OR flex.

Steps

1. Go to this old version of [Apple](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/) and have a look around.

2. Follow the instructions atop the Google Homepage project to set up a Github repository for this project (of course you’ll need to change the title).

3. Create a new HTML document.

4. Think about all the elements on the page and how they are grouped together.

5. Lay out the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and positioned. You may want to make their background colors different so you can see them. Don’t forget to use your browser’s developer tools (right click on the page, click “inspect element”)!

6. Set up the top navigation bar. How is that gradient achieved?

7. Set up the main background image. You can grab that exact image from their webpage by finding the <section id="hero"> tag in your inspector and checking out its background image.

8. Fill in and position the additional sections. Don’t worry about enclosing every paragraph of text in <p> tags.

9. Push your solution to Github.
